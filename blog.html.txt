  <h2>Art Exhibit for Pag-asa Para sa Bata Inc.</h2>
  <p>
    An art exhibit and sale was held where each painting was sold for ₱150.
    All artworks were sold out, and proceeds funded the next activity for
    children in a public school.
  </p>

  <p>
    This initiative served as a “pay-it-forward” model, supporting children
    previously served in private schools under the Pag-asa Project.
  </p>

  <p>
    Identified cases included bullying victims, sexual abuse, dysfunctional
    families, adoption-related concerns, depression, suicidal tendencies,
    and school-related stressors.
